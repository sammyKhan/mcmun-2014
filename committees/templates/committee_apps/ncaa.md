Dear Delegate,

Thank you for your interest in applying for the National Collegiate Athletic Association. This committee will be run by some of McGill’s finest and most experienced staffers as a Specialized Agency. Moreover, the intense background preparation by the dais promises to make NCAA a highly challenging and rewarding endeavour. On that note, Team Committees and the dais encourages the most experienced delegates to apply, who also have the necessary background knowledge.

Below you will find a questionnaire that will allow us to prepare a more enjoyable and productive committee experience. It will also give us insight into the different skills that each interested applicant could bring to the committee, with the goal of creating the most productive committee dynamic possible. Please feel free to contact our Chargée D’Affaires, Marta Canneri if you have any pre-conference question at chargee@mcmun.org. Please note the application is due on November 16th, 2014.


Sincerely,


Brendan Sheehan       
USG Committees, McMUN 2015    

Jonathan Tan Yan
